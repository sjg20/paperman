Installation
------------

Unpack the code into a fresh directory

You will need these packages:

- libqt4-dev

QT4.4 is needed. This is available in various distributions since late 2008.

- libpoppler-qt4-dev

Used for PDF preview

- libpodofo-dev

podofo used to be embedded within the code, but is now available in a
library. This is used for PDF operations.

- libsane-dev

This is the sane scanner library.

- libtiff4-dev

This is the tiff library

- cmake

This is needed to build podofo

- imagemagick
- tesseract-ocr
- tesseract-ocr-eng

These are needed for OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

In summary, to prepare on Debian / Ubuntu:

   sudo apt-get install qtcreator g++ qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libpoppler-qt4-dev \
         libsane-dev libtiff4-dev cmake libpodofo-dev imagemagick \
         tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng

For Red Hat / Centos you will try some other approach similar to the above.


To build:

   qmake
   make


But if you have QT3 installed:

$ qmake -v
Qmake version: 1.07a (Qt 3.3.8b)
Qmake is free software from Trolltech ASA.


then you will need to force QT4:

   qmake-qt4
   make

That should create something called 'paperman'

./paperman

After you run it, right-click in the left window to add a paper repository with
the 'Add repository' option. This should be the directory containing your
paper files.
