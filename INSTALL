Installation
------------

Unpack the code into a fresh directory

You will need these packages:

- libqt5-dev (or libqt4-dev on older distros)

At least QT4.4 is needed. This is available in various distributions since
late 2008.

- libpoppler-qt5-dev (or libpoppler-qt4-dev on older distros)

Used for PDF preview

- libpodofo-dev

podofo used to be embedded within the code, but is now available in a
library. This is used for PDF operations.

- libsane-dev

This is the sane scanner library.

- libtiff5-dev

This is the tiff library

- cmake

This is needed to build podofo

- imagemagick
- tesseract-ocr
- tesseract-ocr-eng

These are needed for OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

In summary, to prepare on Debian / Ubuntu with QT5:

   sudo apt-get install qtcreator g++ qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake \
           qtbase5-dev-tools libsane-dev libtiff5-dev cmake libpodofo-dev \
           imagemagick tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng libpoppler-qt5-dev

but of you only have QT4, then use:

   sudo apt-get install qtcreator g++ qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libpoppler-qt4-dev \
      libsane-dev libtiff5-dev cmake libpodofo-dev imagemagick \
      tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng

For Red Hat / Centos you will try some other approach similar to the above.

To build:

   cd paperman (if needed)
   qmake
   make

But if you have QT3 installed:

$ qmake -v
Qmake version: 1.07a (Qt 3.3.8b)
Qmake is free software from Trolltech ASA.


then you will need to force QT4:

   qmake-qt4
   make

That should create something called 'paperman'

./paperman

After you run it, right-click in the left window to add a paper repository with
the 'Add repository' option. This should be the directory containing your
paper files.
