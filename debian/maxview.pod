=head1 NAME

B<Maxview> - an electronic filing cabinet: scan, print, stack, arrange

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 B<Maxview> [DIR ...]
 B<Maxview> [options...] [FILE]

Conversion options:
   
   -p, --pdf   convert given file to PDF
   -m, --max   convert given file to .max format
   -j, --jpeg  convert given file to JPEG
   
Other options:
   -v, --verbose    be verbose
   -h, --help       display this usage information
   -d, -debug <n>  set debug level (0-3)
   -f, --force      force overwriting of existing file
   -i, --info       display full info about a file

If none of the conversion options is specified, B<Maxview> opens in desktop
mode, displaying thumbnails of the given directory.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Maxview> is a paper management application. It arranges paper into stacks which
are filed into a hierarchy of directories, a little like a traditional paper
filing cabinet. B<Maxview> helps you take control of the paper in your organisation, or
in your life.

B<Maxview> operates with SANE to support scanning of documents. It works particularly
well with sheet-fed scanners, and particularly with Fujitsu ones, which have quite
good SANE support. For example, with any Fujitsu fi-xxxx model, B<Maxview> supports
using in-scanner JPEG compression so that you can happily scan 30 papers per minute
(both sides at once) in colour at 300dpi. B<Maxview>'s scanning dialogue provides for
quick selection of common options such as resolution, monochrome/colour and duplex modes.
In theory B<Maxview> operates with any scanner supported by SANE.

B<Maxview> allows you to arrange your paper in stacks, each stack consisting of one or
more pages. Think of a stack as something that you might staple or attach together
with a paper clip. Stacks can be moved around and positioned on a desktop, or you
can ask B<Maxview> to position them automatically ordered by date or name.

Pages can be stacked together and unstacked. You can drop one stack
onto another to merge them. Each stack has a filename, and each page can be named also.
Stacks and pages can be easily duplicated, renamed and deleted.

B<Maxview> supports full multi-level undo/redo on all operations. It maintains a trash
directory where deleted documents are kept. For convenience, B<Maxview> automatically
renames stacks as required when moving between directories. Stacks can be emailed 
using Thunderbird (other clients are not supported at present) in PDF
format, with a simple 'Email as PDF' menu option.

B<Maxview> supports conversion of paper between different formats. Its native format is a
variant of that used by PaperPort (Windows software by Nuance) and it can read PaperPort
files. This is based on high-speed TIFF compression for monochrome images, and JPEG for
colour. B<Maxview> can convert to and from its native format, PDF and JPEG.

B<Maxview> can print stacks and pages from stacks. B<Maxview> supports printing of multiple
stacks and can place a user-defined footer on each page indicating the page number within
the stack, and the sequence number within the print job, as well as page name and image
information. This might be useful if you are a lawyer although the author makes no
such respresentation.

B<Maxview> is not intended to reduce paper usage. If anything it might increase it, since
it encourages you to scan, bin and later print. Paper is ideal for reading but poor for
filing: electronic filing has many, many advantages. These include multiple simultaneous
access, remote access, fast searching, potential for OCR and keyword search,
instant duplication for filing in multiple places, use of
electronic backup facilities and the satisfying feeling of dumping a load of paper that
has just gone 'into' the computer. If you do not plan to use a piece of paper for a month,
it makes sense to scan it and print it out in a month. Otherwise you might lose it. [The author
finds this very helpful for a muesli recipe which he previously could never find when he needed it.]
If you are an environmentalist, you
can try printing on brown paper or in small print on both sides of the paper. Another technique
is to print on the same page twice, the second time upside down and between the lines. Also
you can look for a printer that can use 100% recycled toilet paper without it catching fire.

B<Maxview> works best with a fast scanner. You can use B<Maxview> with a flatbed scanner but it will
drive you nuts. B<Maxview> does not come with a prescription for blood pressure tablets, so invest
in a nice fast scanner instead. You will never look back.
You can get a 30ppm sheet-fed scanner for about the same price as an equivalent
speed printer and it is well worth it. You will power through paper like never before.

B<Maxview> is very fast to use. Scanning operates in its own thread so can make use of
multi-core machines. PDF preview uses the popular poppler library and PDF creation is done
with PoDoFo, an efficient library for creating PDF files. Clicking a stack brings up a 
scrolling list of the pages in that stack, as well as a preview of the currently selected
page. Predefined views are available for stacking, rearranging and scanning, and the preview
and page list scale can be changed in each using Ctrl+wheel.

B<Maxview> includes rudimentary OCR features so that you can OCR a page and copy out the text.
This uses the Tesseract library. Perhaps this area will improve in future.

=head1 BACKUPS

If you are one of those dopey eggs who can't be bothered to maintain regular backups of
your files, please do not use B<Maxview>. With backups, B<Maxview> is better than paper, since you
might lose the paper or your house or office might burn down. Without backups, B<Maxview> is
worse since you will certainly lose all your paper every five years when you hard disc fails.

B<Maxview> can be used to scan important documents such as birth certificates and passports. These
are then available for printing should copies be needed. However, the scanned copies are not originals,
so please do not throw out documents where an original may be needed.


=head1 OPTIONS

With no options, B<Maxview> will launch and display the set of directories as configured
by the user. If directories are suppled on the command line, then these are used instead.

If conversion options are provided, B<Maxview> will operate in command-line mode. This is
useful for batch conversion of files. See EXAMPLES for some thoughts on this.

=over 8

=item B<-p, --pdf>

Convert the file to PDF format. The output filename will be the same as the input,
but with a .pdf extension.

=item B<-m, --max>

Convert the file to Max format. The output filename will be the same as the input,
but with a .max extension.

=item B<-j, --jpeg>

Convert the file to JPEG format. The output filename will be the same as the input,
but with a .jpg extension.

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Be verbose.

=item B<-h, --help>

Be helpful. This prints the synopsis.

=item B<-f, --force>

B<Maxview> will normally refuse to overwrite existing files when converting between
formats. This option tells B<Maxview> to overwrite any files which get in the way. Use
this option with extreme caution on live data.

=item B<-d, --debug>

Turns on debugging at the given level. If you are using this option you are probably
modifying or enhancing B<Maxview>. For users it offers little benefit.

=item B<-i, --info>

Displays information about the file. This is mainly useful for max files, and again mainly
for modifying or enhancing B<Maxview>.

=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

To convert all the max files in a directory to PDF:

   cd /path/to/dir
   for f in *.pdf; do
      B<Maxview> -p $f
   done

To convert all the max files in a directory and all sub-directories to PDF:

   cd /path/to/dir
   for f in `find . -name "*.pdf"`; do
      B<Maxview> -p $f
   done


=head1 HISTORY

B<Maxview> grew out of the author's waning enthusiasm for keeping his Windows machine running,
particularly as it eventually rotted to the point of required a re-install of the graphics
driver and several reboots each time it was switched on. The computer was called Victor,
after the Meldrew variety for those familiar with the show.

PaperPort, while a great piece of software, is unfortunately a Windows-only program with
all the weird networking, backslashes and C drive nonsense that it entails. Linux has apparently never
represented enough of a market for PaperPort to address.

The first max file decode routines were written in November 2001 but didn't work very well, and
the author limped on with Windows for three more years until Christmas 2004 when a full C-based
Max file decoder
was created. This was heavily based on the work of Marek Behr - a program called PaperView for
the Mac. At QT3-based GUI was added soon after this and B<Maxview> was born. It was fairly
functional but had a number of limitations, notably slow performance with large directories,
no undo/redo, poor printing support and no zooming or previewing of pages.

The release of QT4 provided an opportunity to improve B<Maxview> but the hurdle of the port loomed
in the author's mind and he refrained from moving much past the automated qt3to4 tool. Finally
in May 2009 the author grasped the nettle and rewrote large chunks of the software to use the
model/view architecture and a better abstraction of different file types. Version 0.7 is the
culmination of this effort.


=head1 BUGS

B<Maxview> is reliable in basic use, but bugs do exist. You can report them
at http://B<Maxview>.sourceforge.net/ on the forum. If you would like to help
write B<Maxview>, please get in touch with the author who will be happy.

Scanning A3 monochrome with a standard page size will sometimes not work - you
need to manually adjust the page width to a multiple of 8 pixels.

B<Maxview> should operate with any scanner but the authors is willing to bet that
it won't. The author very much likes playing with fast scanners and will happily
accept a new scanner for a few weeks to assist with integrating buttons,
special scan features, etc. Make sure you lend the scanner to the backend maintainer
first though.


=head1 MISSING FEATURES

The integration of Quite Insane is hap-hazard and needs work.

JPEG support should be improved to allow preview of JPEGs and display of directories
full of images. More generally, display of any type of image format would be nice.

OCR support is basic, to put it kindly. It should operate in a thread.

A paper transmission scheme for organisations with multiple offices or departments
is envisaged but implementation has barely started. In the meantime
you have to email files, or similar.

A manual is sorely needed.

B<Maxview> should support un/stacking of paper in PDF files.

It should be possible to reorder, print, stack and unstack by dragging in the
pageview.


=head1 OTHER MISSING FEATURES

The author thinks these ideas would be nice but will never get time to implement them:

Integration with Nautilus to display max files (with page controls).

Use of the unpaper library to correct scanning deformities

Use of the DjVu library / format.

Thumnailing, conversion and management of other file types, chiefly OpenDocument formats.
The author would quite like to be able to convert a directory full of OpenOffice documents
to PDF with a single menu option.

Faster global search function, using a pre-built index.

Free-text keyword search feature using OCR and PDF content.

Support for email packages other than Thunderbird.

Building for MacOS.

Building for Windows, but really this is a waste of time - the author recommends
you buy PaperPort instead.

Marek Behr provided routines which decoded the Max file format as a whole, rather than
just the images within the file (which are CCITT fax).

M. Allan Noah, who maintains the Fujitsu scanner backend, has helped with many questions over
the years.

B<Maxview> makes use of a large number of libraries, notably the wonderful QT version 4 by
Trolltech, now part of Nokia.
