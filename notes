Working on QT4 version of software

To do:
done - dragging stacks around
done - wheel should scroll window by less
done - drop stacks on stacks
- moving stacks between directories
- click to deselect all stacks
done - confirmation of delete
done - unstack all
done - confirmation of unstack all when more than one stack selected
done - unstack page
done - stack pages

poppler PDF library
http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq27-poppler.html

undo/redo
http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq25-undo.html


20/5/09

Model and view implemented with a decent view delegate. There are a few
small problems (e.g. the view doesn't like overlapping items) but it
is going ok.

About half the popup menu items work. Now I want to take a detour and
implement undo/redo. It doesn't seem too hard.

Complications with undo
- changing model from one directory to another
    - this will have to be in the undo stack
    - the alternative is to clear the undo stack whenever the user changes
         directory which probably renders it useless???
- must use filenames for model indexes, since anything else can change
- deleted pages/stacks will need to be stored in a trash folder
    - this is probably an overdue feature anyway
- problem of having two models: directory and contents
    - if the user renames a directory, then moves a file they expect undo
         to undo both. This involves two models
     - possible solution: attach a global sequence number to all operations
         and make the top-level undo() function call undo on whichever
         model has the most recent operation
- use a class derived from QUndoCommand


- now implemented undo and it seems to work well




4/6/09

Have completed
- printing
- preview, double click, etc.


todo:

done - reset should turn off global and redisplay current dir

5/6/09

done - locate needs to scroll to the located item & select it
done - find button should work
done - check that maxdesk.ini is only written when it should be
done - get model updating working in Desktopdelegate
done - context menu enable/disable items
done - test all operations
done - deleting an unknown file should work - currently gives signature failure
done - display pixmap outline instead of invalid pixmap (crosshatched)
done - store current page number for each stack in maxdesk.ini
done - fix horiz scrollbar to be correct width when loading a new dir

scanning
done - test
done - turn preview widget into a scroll widget, displaying multiple pages at once
done - allow user to scroll this up and down
done - ctrl + wheel to zoom in / out
done - delay scaling of page images
done - only rescale after the user hasn't changed the scale for 0.5 seconds
done - allow selection between single page and multipage views (done with splitter)
done - click on a page to view preview
done - zooming of preview


8/6/09

Created a scanner simulator
- fiddling with the paper size problem again


was 9914 = 209.84633333333333

now 9922 = 210.01566666666666

   FIX = 1387
   UNFIX = 0.02116394
   FIX = 1387

1388 would be 0.021179199
   gives 9915

no - changing directories while scanning then changing back should restart the preview

cvs commit

22/6/09
done - clicking in space should clear selection
done - dragging an item beyond the left margin should not crash
done - clicking on an item and dragging should drag the item, not start a selection drag

26/6/09

Started minor rewrite of the maxdesk setup, to turn it into C++
- ended up doing the same with decpp
- renamed maxdesk to desk
- turned files into a class
- added File and subclasses for different file types
- moved lots of code into Filemax
- rewrote large chunks of the code in Filemax and Desk
- made more use of C++ file structure
- enhanced Desktopmodel to support multiple desks active at once
- introduced masses of bugs

So it has become a major rewrite

30/6/09

Have it sort-of back together but loads of bugs

done - duplicate / undo crash

1/7/09

done - stacking doesn't display correctly
done - moving / undo
done - unstack then undo, doesn't but should

done - duplicate should select the newly created items
done - selecting an item should select the right one

done - get scanning working again
done - get proxies / filtering working again
done - get printing working again
done - test stack operations

ready to commit now I think

- committed

2/7/09

done - PDF thumnails
done - PDF images


[sidetrack on pdf

Unfortunately poppler does not support PDF creation

Could license Acrobat library, fine for our company, but that would severely
limit the ability of others to use this s/w, and hence changes of getting
others to do enhancements.


http://www.cogniview.com/convert-pdf-to-excel/post/pdf-editing-creation-50-open-sourcefree-alternatives-to-adobe-acrobat

Adobe
- cost unknown, royalty unknown

  31. PJ: Etymon’s PJ, the parent of PJX, is one of the earliest open source attempts to make PDF’s more accessible. PJ is a class library in Java that allows parsing, manipulation, and generation of PDF files.
- no good, don't want java

  32. PDFlib: The PDFlib development tool offers a way for developers to PDF-enable software and create PDFs on their own server.
$2k per machine runtime!
- open source option which might have enough features?
- looks ideal, although complex
- might not support stack/unstack though as these features seem to be outside the open source area?
- perhaps could use something else for that

  33. mbtPdfAsm: The mbtPdfAsm application is an in line tool for assembling and merging PDF files, extracting information from them, and updating PDF metadata.
- French comments
- C++
- looks like it might be enough, but not sure about creating images
- little source documentation
- not a library, no API

  34. PDF::API2: PDF::API2 offers a “next generation” tool for creating and manipulating PDF files.
- perl

  35. PDF Clown: The PDF Clown is an open source library which includes capabilities such as document splitting, merging, and more.
- is java/c sharp

  36. iText: iText is an ideal library for developers seeking to automate PDF creation and manipulation.
- looks good, but java

  37. FreeDist: This freeware distiller can convert files into PDF as well as compose multiple files to one PDF in a specific order.
- ugly, a distiller, perhaps like gs

  38. Pdftk: This toolkit offers command-line functionality for lots of features, like merging, form filling, and encryption.
- looks like a good command line tool
- not maintained for 3 years though
- not a library
- might not handle image import
- based on iText

PDF Creator Pilot
- commercial software, with developer license, so could potentially
   include a binary library with maxview. No royalty so could distribute
- not ideal, but a possibility
- seems to support stacking, thumnailing, extract images, etc.!
- looks good

Cairo
- seems to be only for output to PDF

PoDoFo
- looks good
- does not render (but we can use Poppler for that)
- handles stack, etc.
- handles PDF creation
- seems to support embedded images


(found Lua, a scripting language)


Summary:
- pdflib looks like the best option due to open source option
- but doesn't seem to support stack/unstack

- Adobe library does not appear to have an open source option
- Would prefer to use Adobe but that would limit the app to licensed people

- pdftk is C++ (but mostly java), really want to avoid java!

- which leaves mbtPdfAsm, oh dear

- xpdf library, looks to be suitable, this is the source of pdfimages, etc.
- found pdfedit which seems to be QT3-based. Uses xpdf

ClibPDF - suggest Haru or pdflib

- Haru looks similar to pdflib in that it doesn't seem to support modifying existing files

- xpdf doesn't seem to create PDF

Probably PoDoFo is best?

done - duplicate max and related


done - conversion to pdf

4/7/09

done - get podofo image access working
done - display PDF thumbnails if present
done - generate thumbnails when outputting PDF
done - duplicate PDF as PDF and max
done - check greyscale images

commit


conversion between PDF and max now seems to work for different image sizes/depths
need to take another look a Filepage though, it should have functions for returning
image data in various required formats:

- with either byte or word alignment of each scanline
    - Qt and common sense requires word, PDF requires byte
- forcing 32bpp to 24bpp
- a jpeg-encoded image
- thumbnails at different sizes
- this could perhaps be used by the various viewers so there is a unified place
      for obtaining images from files and all scaling, encoding is done in one
      place
- other?


5/7/09

done - pagewidget view should display hatch pattern until images are available when first opened


8/7/09

done - after scanning a page, transfer to the scan image to the page so it displays that (until updated)
      instead of hatching

done - save maxdesk when changing directory
done - save maxdesk every minute
done - rename maxdesk.ini to .desk
done - fix moving of files between desks which are open in the model

done - large memory leak when scanning colour pages

done - integrate omnipage ocr

15/7/09

done - make it select a top level root in dirview (it does, but then deselects immediately afterwards)

5/8/09

done - add email, email as pdf, email as max functions
done - fix PDF conversion so that it produces a correct thumbnail for non-word-aligned bytes per line images

7/8/09

done - add send option
done - add users
done - add transfer class
done - add inbox and outbox
done - add envelope info to max file
done - implement sending to outbox
done - add envelope to max files in outbox

It appears to include a free software license, but not one I recognise

Hello Simon,

Since my code (EpegWrapper) is just a thin wrapper around the epeg library from the enlightenment project, you can consider it covered by exactly the same license as epeg itself. You're encouraged to give credit to me and/or link to EpegWrapper's URL at http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/#epegwrapper, but you're not required to.

I haven't worked on it in a long time, and I suspect that these days Apple's CoreImage frameworks might be faster, especially on modern machines. You might want to look into my CoreImageTool for playing around with that:

Cheers & good luck with your software

Marc

Need to remove:
ctlTreeView.cpp,h
qtdirectorybrowser-1.0-enterprise


- add 'send' function to mark files to be sent

done - start delivery agent


10/9/09

Dapper packaging

Build QT 4.5.2 on Dapper
added backports to install cmake
also zlib1g-dev libtiff4-dev libttf-dev libcppunit-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev
remove gdbmacros

Gave up on Dapper package. It does not have QT4, which I built, but poppler
needs either cairo or splash backend and I gave up at that point.


16/9/09

Enhancing PDF support

done - implement stacking
- implement unstacking



delivery agent

done (not needed) - get it reading max files
done - scan for files to move to transfer area
(not needed?) - move to transfer area
- deliver
- accept connections
- make connections to other agents
- exchange info about users
- exchange files
- exchange delivery reports
- create log file
- write to log file
- delivery report
- read report
- processing report


- sent box
- new delegate to show sender info on side of pixmap
- sent box shows delivery reports


- operations on a subdir desk should work correctly (e.g. delete is ok, but then undo adds to the pwd
    instead of the original file's dir)

- return to desktop button should be more obvious, or highlight

- one day should increase preview scale factor to 16 instead of 24
    - but will need to handle displaying preview images on Desktopview
         at a fixed scale instead of just using the preview size
- saving annotations should only happen if changed
- purge desk files or pixmaps when we change directory (to save memory)
- or perhaps purge the whole desk and leave a hole in the model

- save ocr text back to max file
- keyboard shortcuts for scanning
- perhaps allow reordering of pages
- try OpenGL
- implement notes
- item search when clicking in Desktopview needs a revisit:
     - use the more restrictive multiple bounding boxes for clicking
     - if an item is selected, then it should get priority (clicking over it should always return that item)

4/2/10

done - remove display of .max extension on files (should be suppressed)


3/4/10

done - sometimes first item in directory is shown as corrupted

This happens when Desktopview::currentChanged() is called on an item not
currently visible. For example, if you open a long viewer and the first item
is not visible, QT selects it as the current item even though it isn't valid
yet


done - filter without subdir set is flaky
done - opening a new directory should scroll so that at least some items are visible
done- subdir search inserts double slashes in the filename of files


- double click on a stack to open page view. Then print - crashes. Should print current page.
